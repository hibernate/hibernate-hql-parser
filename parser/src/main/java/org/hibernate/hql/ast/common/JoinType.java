/**
 * Represents a canonical join type.
 * <p/>
 * Note that currently HQL really only supports inner and left outer joins
 * (though cross joins can also be achieved).  This is because joins in HQL
 * are always defined in relation to a mapped association.  However, when we
 * start allowing users to specify ad-hoc joins this may need to change to
 * allow the full spectrum of join types.  Thus the others are provided here
 * currently just for completeness and for future expansion.
